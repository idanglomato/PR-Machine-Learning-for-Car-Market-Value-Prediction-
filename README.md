## Machine Learning for Car Market Value Prediction

### Description
Rusty Bargain is a used car buying and selling company that is currently developing an application to attract new buyers. In this application, you can quickly determine the market value of your car. You have access to historical data, technical specifications of vehicles, vehicle model versions, and vehicle prices. Your task is to create a model that can determine the market value of cars.

Rusty Bargain is interested in:
* prediction accuracy;
* model speed in making predictions;
* time required to train the model.

### Objectives
Create a model that can determine the market value of cars with high accuracy, high prediction speed and low training time.

NB. Since the dataset is more than 25MB, it is not uploaded to this repository.
